	<h2>DRIVE LYRICS</h2>
	<div class="tag"> — Verse 1 —</div><br>
	<div class="verse">
		Sat back with the window down <br>
		Eighty an hour and the radio loud <br>
		The same songs with the same old rhymes <br>
		Tell me to shake it off and swing from the lights <br>
	</div><br>
	<div class="tag">— Pre-Chorus —</div><br>
	<div class="verse">
		But I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made <br>
		You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away <br>
		And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy <br>
		Darling, please believe me <br>
	</div><br>
		<div class="tag">— Chorus —</div><br>
		<div class="chorus">
		Cause loving you, loving you is too hard<br>
		All I do, all I do is not enough <br>
		Loving you, loving you <br>
		I cannot be loving you, loving you <br>
		Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt <br>
		All I do, all I do is get burned <br>
		Loving you, loving you <br>
		I cannot be loving you, loving you <br>
	</div><br>
		<div class="tag">— Verse 2 —</div><br>
		<div class="verse">
		Count stacks of the routine lies <br>
		Funny how easy you could see my blindside <br>
		Still the same songs with the same old beats <br>
		Sure, I could stay, but there’s a place I’d rather be <br>
	</div><br>
	<div class="tag">— Pre-Chorus —</div><br>
	<div class="verse">
		But I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made <br>
		You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away <br>
		And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy <br>
		Darling, please believe me <br>

		Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt<br>
		All I do, all I do is get burned<br>

	<div class="tag">— Bridge —</div><br>
		<div class="bridge">
		See, I remember all the times you made me covered in crazy<br>
		I can’t forget about the way you played me<br>
		Like I was never gonna change your world<br>
		It ended long ago, so please just let me go<br>
		It ended long ago, so please just let me go<br>
