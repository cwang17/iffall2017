<h2> Notes </h2>
<ul>- Text on landing page will appear slowly, one after the other (to mimic slow pace of the movie)</ul>
<ul>- The button (Hal) will appear last, and when you hover over it, the text "Hal: Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?" will appear in bold.</ul>
<ul>- Clicking the button leads to the information page.</ul>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ul>- Should the landing space feel more immersive? Should I make it a scrolling experience and have the viewers be more situated in "space"?</ul>
<ul>- Is the text box distracting/does it fit the vibe of the movie? I can change the way information is presented.</ul>
<ul>- Also, is the kind of information presented OK? </ul>
