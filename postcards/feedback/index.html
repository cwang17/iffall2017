Feedback for Marina 
- Type placement: have it relate more to the image
	- 1st image: it feels kind of tight with the margins
	- 2nd image: it could be placed in a space around the figure instead of floating on top.
	- 3rd image: still a bit tight, maybe have the line of text flow behind the guy
- Color: I like how the third one uses colors from the image, try that with the other two so it feels more incorporated
- Info: Consider adding the person's name on it, also to have another element to work with.
- Technical: 
	- Images get blurry when zoomed in, try using the whole image or finding a higher resolution one
	- This could just be from viewing on a computer screen though
