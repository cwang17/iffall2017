<h1>Feedback for Marina </h1>
<ul>Type placement: have it relate more to the image</ul>
	<ul>- 1st image: it feels kind of tight with the margins</ul>
	<ul>- 2nd image: it could be placed in a space around the figure instead of floating on top.</ul>
	<ul>- 3rd image: still a bit tight, maybe have the line of text flow behind the guy</ul>
<ul>Color: I like how the third one uses colors from the image, try that with the other two so it feels more incorporated</ul>
<ul>Info: Consider adding the person's name on it, also to have another element to work with.</ul>
<ul>Technical: </ul>
	<ul>- Images get blurry when zoomed in, try using the whole image or finding a higher resolution one</ul>
	<ul>- This could just be from viewing on a computer screen though</ul>
</ul>
